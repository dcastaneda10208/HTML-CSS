            <p>Toby is a white and gray male shih tzo dog who three years of age. He was born in Aurora, IL sometime around January of 2013. He has a very energetic spirit and he also has old people attributes.</p>
            <p>His favorite color is yellow and he says hello by sniffing you all over. There are times where he can get a little too friendly... He likes to eat grass and rabbit poop, so get read for him to puke later on. He looks like a white, fluffy teddy bear, but when he takes a shower, he looks like a rat with big eyes. Also. Toby is afraid of the bathroom and stairs.</p>
            <p>Toby is a good dog. He has some bad attributes, but we all do as well. All you have to do if get to know him and I'm sure you'll like Toby. </p>

            <h3>Behavior</h3>
            <p>Toby's behaviors consists of multiple variations depending on the day. He can be very energetic and/or very lazy on some days. I guess is really depends on the weather. On days where is rainy and gloomy, he just want to sleeps all day and do nothing. He behaves really well and he never really has a bad day. </p>
            <h3>Playtime</h3>
            <p>Toby enjoys playtime, whether it is outside or inside. When he is playing outside, he enjoys chaing around a green ball that is all chewed up. But he doesn't plau outside too much because since he had white hair, he easily can get dirty. When he is playing inside, he has a number a toys that he can choose from and play with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Blue non-squeaky shoe</li>
                <li>Tug of war rope</li>
                <li>Yellow duck stuffed animal</li>
                <li>Tug of war lasso</li>
            </ul>
            <p> If Toby plays with his Toy duck too much, make sure you wash his duck. The yellow duck is wash friendly. </p>
            <h3>Feeding</h3>
            <p>Toby generally eats his food in the morning but not too early in the morning and later at night but not too late either. When you eat your breakfast, lunch and dinner Toby will most definently be right by your side watching you eat. It's not intended to make you feel uncomfortable, but it's because he wants what you are eating. You can give him what you are eating depending on if he will eat it or not. His favorite type of food is meat. </p>
            <h3>Naptime and Sleeping</h3>
            <p>Naptime and sleeping are completely one in the same. More than half of a day, Toby sleeps, or should I say nap, all day and everyday. Even if it really looks like that he is napping, he can easily be woken up. Any little noise that you make, he will wake up. He likes to use shoes, blankets, sweaters and prettu much anything as a pillow. Overnight sleeping is when he sleeps through the entire nights. There are some nights where he will wake up and begin to scartch his ears. When that happens he will most likely cry really loud. Just tell him to stop and he should be good. </p>
            <h3>Going for a Walk</h3>
            <p>There are days where he is really lazy and sleepy that he absolutely does not want to do anything. There are days where he is super hyper that he goes out of control and doesn't know when to stop. All of this also depends on the weather. On rainy days is when Toby is really lazy. He doesn't even want to go outside to go to the bathroom. On really hot days, he will go out but half way through the walk, he will stop and sit down where ever we are. It doesn't matter if we are on the middle of a street, he will sit down there and not move. </p>
